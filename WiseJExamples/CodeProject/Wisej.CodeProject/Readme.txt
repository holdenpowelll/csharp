CodeProject Sample
==================

This sample uses the x64 SQLite driver which doesn't work when debugging using IIS Express x86.
To switch to IIS Express x64 follow these steps:

	Tools->Options

	Scroll to "Projects & Solutions"

	Under "Web Projects" check "Use the 64 bit version of IIS Express for web sites and projects".
